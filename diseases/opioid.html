    <h2 id="opioid" class="subheading">What are Opiods?</h2>
    <p>Opioids are natural or synthetic (made in laboratories to mimic the properties of natural opioids) chemicals that interact with opioid receptors on the nerve cells in the body and brain and reduce feelings of pain. They are a class of drugs that include prescription pain relievers, synthetic opioids and heroin. Prescription opioids are meant to be used to treat acute pain (such as recovering from injury or post-surgery), chronic pain, active-phase cancer treatment, palliative care and end-of-life care. Many people rely on prescription opioids to help manage their conditions under the care of a physician. <br>
        Opioids reduce the perception of pain, but can also cause drowsiness, mental confusion, euphoria, nausea and constipation. At high doses they can depress respiration. Prescription pain relievers include oxycodone (OxyContin®) hydrocodone (Vicodin®), codeine, morphine, and others. Synthetic opioids include fentanyl, methadone, pethidine, tramadol and carfentanil.</p>
        <h2 id="oud" class="subheading">Opioid Use Disorder</h2>
        <p>OUD is defined by opioid use that’s hard to stop or reduce for several reasons. This is at least partially because opioids have a high potential for dependence and addiction.</p>

        <h2 class="subheading" id="treatment">Next Steps for Treatment</h2>
        <h2 class="subheading">Medications for Opioid Use Disorder</h2>
        <p>Three FDA-approved medications are commonly used to treat opioid addiction:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Methadone</b>- Prevents withdrawal symptoms and reduces cravings in people addicted to opioids. It does not cause a euphoric feeling once patients become tolerant to its effects. It is available only in specially regulated clinics.</li>
            <li><b>Buprenorphine</b>- Blocks the effects of other opioids, reduces or eliminates withdrawal symptoms and reduces cravings. Buprenorphine treatment (detoxification or maintenance) is provided by specially trained and qualified physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants (having received a waiver from the Drug Enforcement Administration) in office-based settings.</li>
            <li><b>Naltrexone</b>- Blocks the effects of other opioids preventing the feeling of euphoria. It is available from office-based providers in pill form or monthly injection.</li>

        </ul>
        <h2 class="subheading">Counseling and Behavioral Therapies for Opioid Addiction Treatment</h2>
        <p>Your chances of beating narcotic addiction are better with long-term maintenance therapy that includes medications along with some form of counseling or behavioral therapy. This is known as medication-assisted treatment (MAT). <br>
            Counseling with a qualified health professional helps you deal with any personal or social problems that may be leading to addiction or making it worse. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your feelings of self-worth</li>
                <li>Problems at work or home</li>
                <li>People around you who use drugs or alcohol</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="subheading">Treatment Program may include:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Contingency management</b> uses incentives or rewards to help you meet goals such as sticking with medications or attending treatment.</li>
                <li><b>Motivational interviewing </b>helps you identify reasons why you might not want to change your behavior.</li>
                <li><b>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</b> hows you why you might be using drugs, builds your belief that you can address your problems, and teaches you to cope with struggles more effectively.</li>
                <li><b>Family therapy </b>brings in people who care about you to strengthen your treatment.</li>
                <li><b>12-step groups</b> involve defined goals such as attending meetings or getting a sponsor.</li>
                <li><b>Support groups </b>introduce you to people who know from experience what you’re going through. They can offer their own tips for recovery and help you deal with any setbacks.</li>
