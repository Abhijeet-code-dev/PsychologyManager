    <h2 id="sud" class="subheading">What is Substance Use Disorder?</h2>
    <p>Substance use disorder is a 
        complex condition stemming 
        from the recurrent use of 
        alcohol or other substances despite the harmful life and health consequences it may cause.<br/>

        A SUD can be mild, moderate, or severe.<br/>
        Addiction often occurs when the substance overactivates the brain’s reward center, which involves an abnormally high release of the neurotransmitter dopamine.<br/>
    <br/>
    Continued use of the substance results in changes to the brain’s function and structure, which eventually leads to cravings, tolerance, and withdrawal symptoms when the substance isn’t used.
