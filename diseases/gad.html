    <p>Symptoms of GAD include restlessness, fatigue, muscle tension, and irritability. There are many ways to treat these symptoms.<br>
        Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is more than just the worries most people will experience on occasion.

        GAD is a type of anxiety disorder that’s chronic, involving excessive worry and tension even when there’s nothing to provoke it.
    <br>
    According to the DSM-5 criteriaTrusted Source, to be diagnosed with GAD you must experience your symptoms for most days over a 6-month period. You must have 3 or more of the following 6 symptoms in this period:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Feeling Restless, Keyed up, or on Edge</li>
        <li>Having difficulty concentrating or feeling like your mind is “blank”</li>
        <li>Being Irritable</li>
        <li>Fatiguing easily</li>
        <li>Tension in muscles</li>
        <li>Experiencing sleep issues such as difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep</li>
    </ul>
    <p>symptoms of GAD can go beyond the diagnostic symptoms outlined above, and can include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>feeling a general sense of nervousness</li>
        <li>being easily startled</li>
        <li>experiencing headaches, muscle aches, or stomachaches, or other unexplained pains</li>
        <li>having difficulty swallowing or feeling a lump in your throat</li>
        <li>twitching or trembling</li>
        <li>sweating a lot or experiencing hot flashes</li>
        <li>feeling lightheaded or out of breath</li>
        <li>feeling nauseated</li>
        <li>having to use the bathroom a lot</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        GAD may come on gradually, with many people reporting feeling at least mild anxiety symptoms for their entire lives. An anxiety disorder can begin at any time — in childhood, adolescence, or even late adulthood.
        <br>
GAD is reportedly more common in women than in men and often occurs in relatives of people with anxiety disorders, meaning there may be a genetic component.
    </p>
    <h2 id="daigonose" class="subheading">When is GAD diagnosed?</h2>
    GAD is diagnosed when someone spends more days than not over at least 6 months worried excessively about a number of everyday problems, including health, money, family, or work.
<br>
Sometimes, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint. Simply the thought of getting through the day may provoke anxiety.
<br>
People with GAD can’t seem to shake their concerns or control their worry, even though they usually realize that their anxiety may be more intense than the situation warrants.
