    <p>Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease your ability to function at work and at home.</p>
    <h2 class="subheading" id="symptoms">Symptoms of Depression</h2>
    <p>Depression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Feeling sad or having a depressed mood</li>
        <li>Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed</li>
        <li>Changes in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting</li>
        <li>Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much</li>
        <li>Loss of energy or increased fatigue</li>
        <li>Increase in purposeless physical activity (e.g., inability to sit still, pacing, handwringing) or slowed movements or speech (these actions must be severe enough to be observable by others)</li>
        <li>Feeling worthless or guilty</li>
        <li>Difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions</li>
        <li>Thoughts of death or suicide</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Symptoms must last at least two weeks and must represent a change in your previous level of functioning for a diagnosis of depression.
        <br>Also, medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems, a brain tumor or vitamin deficiency) can mimic symptoms of depression so it is important to rule out general medical causes.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subheading">Statistics related to Depression</h2>
    <p>Depression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7%) in any given year. And one in six people (16.6%) will experience depression at some time in their life. Depression can occur at any time, but on average, first appears during the late teens to mid-20s. Women are more likely than men to experience depression. Some studies show that one-third of women will experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime. There is a high degree of heritability (approximately 40%) when first-degree relatives (parents/children/siblings) have depression.</p>
    <h2 class="subheading">Depression V/S Grief or Sadness</h2>
    <p>The death of a loved one, loss of a job or the ending of a relationship are difficult experiences for a person to endure. It is normal for feelings of sadness or grief to develop in response to such situations. Those experiencing loss often might describe themselves as being “depressed.”
<br>
        But being sad is not the same as having depression. The grieving process is natural and unique to each individual and shares some of the same features of depression. Both grief and depression may involve intense sadness and withdrawal from usual activities. They are also different in important ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>n grief, painful feelings come in waves, often intermixed with positive memories of the deceased. In major depression, mood and/or interest (pleasure) are decreased for most of two weeks.</li>
            <li>In grief, self-esteem is usually maintained. In major depression, feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common.</li>
            <li>In grief, thoughts of death may surface when thinking of or fantasizing about “joining” the deceased loved one. In major depression, thoughts are focused on ending one’s life due to feeling worthless or undeserving of living or being unable to cope with the pain of depression.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="subheading" id="dtypes">Types of Depression</h2>
        <h2 class="subheading" id="major">Major Depression</h2>
        <p>You may hear your doctor call this "major depressive disorder." You might have this type if you feel depressed most of the time for most days of the week.Some other symptoms you might have:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Loss of interest or pleasure in your activities</li>
        <li>Weight loss or gain</li>
        <li>Trouble getting to sleep or feeling sleepy during the day</li>
        <li>Feeling restless and agitated, or else very sluggish and slowed down physically or mentally</li>
        <li>Being tired and without energy</li>
        <li>Feeling worthless or guilty</li>
        <li>Thoughts of suicide</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="persistent" class="subheading">Persistent Depressive Disorder</h2>
    <p>If you have depression that lasts for 2 years or longer, it's called persistent depressive disorder. This term is used to describe two conditions previously known as dysthymia (low-grade persistent depression) and chronic major depression.
        <br>
        You may have symptoms such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Change in your appetite (not eating enough or overeating)</li>
            <li>Sleeping too much or too little</li>
            <li>Lack of energy, or fatigue</li>
            <li>Low self-esteem</li>
            <li>Trouble concentrating or making decisions</li>
            <li>Feeling hopeless</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may be treated with psychotherapy, medication, or a combination of the two.</p>
        <h2 class="subheading" id="bipolar">Bipolar Disorder</h2>
        <p>
            Someone with bipolar disorder, which is also sometimes called "manic depression," has mood episodes that range from extremes of high energy with an "up" mood to low "depressive" periods.
 <br>
When you're in the low phase, you'll have the symptoms of major depression.
<br>You may have following Symptoms:

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Bipolar I Disorder— </b>defined by manic episodes that last at least 7 days, or by manic symptoms that are so severe that the person needs immediate hospital care. Usually, depressive episodes occur as well, typically lasting at least 2 weeks. Episodes of depression with mixed features (having depressive symptoms and manic symptoms at the same time) are also possible.</li>
            <li><b>Bipolar II Disorder—</b> defined by a pattern of depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes, but not the full-blown manic episodes that are typical of Bipolar I Disorder.</li>
            <li><b>Cyclothymic Disorder (also called Cyclothymia)—</b>defined by periods of hypomanic symptoms as well as periods of depressive symptoms lasting for at least 2 years (1 year in children and adolescents). However, the symptoms do not meet the diagnostic requirements for a hypomanic episode and a depressive episode.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sometimes a person might experience symptoms of bipolar disorder that do not match the three categories listed above, which is referred to as “other specified and unspecified bipolar and related disorders.” <br>
            Bipolar disorder is typically diagnosed during late adolescence (teen years) or early adulthood. Occasionally, bipolar symptoms can appear in children. Bipolar disorder can also first appear during a woman’s pregnancy or following childbirth. Although the symptoms may vary over time, bipolar disorder usually requires lifelong treatment. Following a prescribed treatment plan can help people manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life.</p>
            <h2 id="seasonal" class="subheading">Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)</h2>
            <p>Seasonal affective disorder is a period of major depression that most often happens during the winter months, when the days grow short and you get less and less sunlight. It typically goes away in the spring and summer.
                <br>
                If you have SAD, antidepressants can help. So can light therapy. You'll need to sit in front of a special bright light box for about 15-30 minutes each day.</p>
                <h2 id="psychotic" class="subheading">Psychotic Depression</h2>
                <p>People with psychotic depression have the symptoms of major depression along with "psychotic" symptoms, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there)</li>
                    <li>Delusions (false beliefs)</li>
                    <li>Paranoia (wrongly believing that others are trying to harm you)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A combination of antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs can treat psychotic depression. ECT may also be an option.</p>
                <h2 class="subheading" id="postpartum">Postpartum Depression</h2>
                <p>It is also known as Peripartum Depression. Women who have major depression in the weeks and months after childbirth may have peripartum depression. Approximately 1 in 10 men also experience depression in the peripartum period. Antidepressant drugs can help similarly to treating major depression that is unrelated to childbirth.  </p>
                <h2 class="subheading" id="premenstrual">Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)</h2>
                <p>Women with PMDD have depression and other symptoms at the start of their period.
                    <br>
                    Besides feeling depressed, you may also have:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mood swings</li>
                        <li>Irritability</li>
                        <li>Anxiety</li>
                        <li>Trouble concentrating</li>
                        <li>Fatigue</li>
                        <li>Change in appetite or sleep habits</li>
                        <li>Feelings of being overwhelmed</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Antidepressant medication or sometimes oral contraceptives can treat PMDD.</p>
                    <h2 class="subheading">How Is Depression Treated?</h2>
                    <p>Before a diagnosis or treatment, a health professional should conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including an interview and a physical examination. In some cases, a blood test might be done to make sure the depression is not due to a medical condition like a thyroid problem or a vitamin deficiency (reversing the medical cause would alleviate the depression-like symptoms). The evaluation will identify specific symptoms and explore medical and family histories as well as cultural and environmental factors with the goal of arriving at a diagnosis and planning a course of action.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Medication-</b> Brain chemistry may contribute to an individual’s depression and may factor into their treatment. For this reason, antidepressants might be prescribed to help modify one’s brain chemistry. These medications are not sedatives, “uppers” or tranquilizers. They are not habit-forming. Generally antidepressant medications have no stimulating effect on people not experiencing depression. <br>Psychiatrists usually recommend that patients continue to take medication for six or more months after the symptoms have improved. Longer-term maintenance treatment may be suggested to decrease the risk of future episodes for certain people at high risk. </li>
                        <li> <b>Psychotherapy-</b> Psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” is sometimes used alone for treatment of mild depression; for moderate to severe depression, psychotherapy is often used along with antidepressant medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective in treating depression. CBT is a form of therapy focused on the problem solving in the present. CBT helps a person to recognize distorted/negative thinking with the goal of changing thoughts and behaviors to respond to challenges in a more positive manner. <br>Psychotherapy may involve only the individual, but it can include others. For example, family or couples therapy can help address issues within these close relationships. Group therapy brings people with similar illnesses together in a supportive environment, and can assist the participant to learn how others cope in similar situations. <br>Depending on the severity of the depression, treatment can take a few weeks or much longer. In many cases, significant improvement can be made in 10 to 15 sessions.</li>
                        <li><b>Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)-</b> ECT is a medical treatment that has been most commonly reserved for patients with severe major depression who have not responded to other treatments. It involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under anesthesia. A patient typically receives ECT two to three times a week for a total of six to 12 treatments. It is usually managed by a team of trained medical professionals including a psychiatrist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse or physician assistant. ECT has been used since the 1940s, and many years of research have led to major improvements and the recognition of its effectiveness as a mainstream rather than a "last resort" treatment.</li>
                        <li><b>Self-help and Coping-</b> There are a number of things people can do to help reduce the symptoms of depression. For many people, regular exercise helps create positive feeling and improves mood. Getting enough quality sleep on a regular basis, eating a healthy diet and avoiding alcohol (a depressant) can also help reduce symptoms of depression. <br>Depression is a real illness and help is available. With proper diagnosis and treatment, the vast majority of people with depression will overcome it. If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, a first step is to see your family physician or psychiatrist. Talk about your concerns and request a thorough evaluation. This is a start to addressing your mental health needs.</li>
