    <img class="responsive" src="../images/eat.jpeg" alt="Eating and Feeding Disorder">
    <p>There are several types of eating disorders, each involving different symptoms. Anyone can have an eating disorder, regardless of race, gender, sexuality, and other demographics.
        <br>
        According to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, eating disorders affect at least 9% of the world’s population. Eating disorders affect mental and physical health. They can be life threatening if left untreated.<br>
