    <h1>Schizophrenia</h1>
  <img class="responsive" src="../images/schizo1.jpg" alt="Person having delusions">
  <p>Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder in which people interpret reality abnormally. Schizophrenia may result in some combination of hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered thinking and behavior that impairs daily functioning, and can be disabling.</p>
  <h2 class="subheading" id="symptoms">Symptoms of Schizophrenia</h2>
  <p>Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking (cognition), behavior and emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. Symptoms may include:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><b>Delusions.</b> These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you're being harmed or harassed; certain gestures or comments are directed at you; you have exceptional ability or fame; another person is in love with you; or a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia.</li>
      <li><b>Hallucinations.</b> These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don't exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, they have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination.</li>
      <li> <b>Disorganized thinking (speech).</b> Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless words that can't be understood, sometimes known as word salad.</li>
      <li> <b>Extremely disorganized or abnormal motor behavior.</b> This may show in a number of ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behavior isn't focused on a goal, so it's hard to do tasks. Behavior can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement.</li>
      <li><b>Negative symptoms.</b> This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion (doesn't make eye contact, doesn't change facial expressions or speaks in a monotone). Also, the person may lose interest in everyday activities, socially withdraw or lack the ability to experience pleasure.</li>

  </ul>
  <p>Symptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of worsening and remission of symptoms. Some symptoms may always be present.
<br>
    In men, schizophrenia symptoms typically start in the early to mid-20s. In women, symptoms typically begin in the late 20s. It's uncommon for children to be diagnosed with schizophrenia and rare for those older than age 45.</p>
    <h2 class="subheading">Symptoms in teenagers</h2>
    <p>Schizophrenia symptoms in teenagers are similar to those in adults, but the condition may be more difficult to recognize. This may be in part because some of the early symptoms of schizophrenia in teenagers are common for typical development during teen years, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Withdrawal from friends and family</li>
        <li>A drop in performance at school</li>
        <li>Trouble sleeping</li>
        <li>Irritability or depressed mood</li>
        <li>Lack of motivation</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="complications" class="subheading">Complications</h2>
    <p>Left untreated, schizophrenia can result in severe problems that affect every area of life. Complications that schizophrenia may cause or be associated with include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Suicide, suicide attempts and thoughts of suicide</li>
        <li>Anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)</li>
        <li>Depression</li>
        <li>Abuse of alcohol or other drugs, including nicotine</li>
        <li>Inability to work or attend school</li>
        <li>Social isolation</li>
        <li>Being victimized</li>
        <li>Aggressive behavior, although it's uncommon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="treatment" class="subheading">Treatment of Schizophrenia</h2>
    <p>
        Schizophrenia requires lifelong treatment, even when symptoms have subsided. Treatment with medications and psychosocial therapy can help manage the condition. In some cases, hospitalization may be needed.
<br>
A psychiatrist experienced in treating schizophrenia usually guides treatment. The treatment team also may include a psychologist, social worker, psychiatric nurse and possibly a case manager to coordinate care. The full-team approach may be available in clinics with expertise in schizophrenia treatment.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Medications:</b> Medications are the cornerstone of schizophrenia treatment, and antipsychotic medications are the most commonly prescribed drugs. They're thought to control symptoms by affecting the brain neurotransmitter dopamine.<br>
        The goal of treatment with antipsychotic medications is to effectively manage signs and symptoms at the lowest possible dose. The psychiatrist may try different drugs, different doses or combinations over time to achieve the desired result. Other medications also may help, such as antidepressants or anti-anxiety drugs. It can take several weeks to notice an improvement in symptoms.

    </li>
    <li><b>Psychosocial interventions</b>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Individual therapy.</b> Psychotherapy may help to normalize thought patterns. Also, learning to cope with stress and identify early warning signs of relapse can help people with schizophrenia manage their illness.</li>
       <li><b>Social skills training. </b>This focuses on improving communication and social interactions and improving the ability to participate in daily activities.</li>
       <li><b>Family therapy.</b> This provides support and education to families dealing with schizophrenia.</li>
       <li><b>Vocational rehabilitation and supported employment. </b> This focuses on helping people with schizophrenia prepare for, find and keep jobs.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
