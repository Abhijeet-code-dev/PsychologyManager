    <h2 class="subheading">Social Anxiety Disorder</h2>
   <p> When you’re around others, you may feel like you’re always onstage — and the audience is just waiting for you to mess up. Fear of embarrassment often stops you from participating in conversations, making it difficult to connect with people.
<br>
For people with social anxiety disorder — previously called social phobia — these thoughts can be frustratingly common.
</p>
<h2 class="subheading" id="shy">Social anxiety vs. shyness</h2>
<p>Some people confuse shyness with social anxiety. While social anxiety disorder is a diagnosable condition, shyness is better described as a personality trait.
<br>
    Social anxiety disorder often disrupts day-to-day life in a way that shyness doesn’t.
    <br>
    For example, you may find that social anxiety gets in the way of your job or relationships. And while shy people sometimes avoid social situations, a person with social anxiety disorder may do this more often and experience more life disruption as a result
    <br>Having social anxiety disorder also doesn’t always mean that you’re shy. You might feel at ease with people most of the time and only feel anxious in certain situations, such as walking in a public place, making a speech, or interacting with strangers.
