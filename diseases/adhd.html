    <h1>Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</h1>
    <img class="responsive" src="../images/adhd1.jpg" alt="Child unable to concentrate">
    <p>ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood. It is usually first diagnosed in childhood and often lasts into adulthood. Children with ADHD may have trouble paying attention, controlling impulsive behaviors (may act without thinking about what the result will be), or be overly active.</p>
    <h2 class="subheading" id="signs">Signs and Symptoms of ADHD</h2>
    <p>It is normal for children to have trouble focusing and behaving at one time or another. However, children with ADHD do not just grow out of these behaviors. The symptoms continue, can be severe, and can cause difficulty at school, at home, or with friends.A child with ADHD might:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>daydream a lot</li>
        <li>forget or lose things a lot</li>
        <li>squirm or fidget</li>
        <li>talk too much</li>
        <li>make careless mistakes or take unnecessary risks</li>
        <li>have a hard time resisting temptation</li>
        <li>have trouble taking turns</li>
        <li>have difficulty getting along with others</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="types" class="subheading">Types of ADHD</h2>
    <p>There are three different types of ADHD, depending on which types of symptoms are strongest in the individual:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Predominantly Inattentive Presentation: It is hard for the individual to organize or finish a task, to pay attention to details, or to follow instructions or conversations. The person is easily distracted or forgets details of daily routines.</li>
        <li>Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation: The person fidgets and talks a lot. It is hard to sit still for long (e.g., for a meal or while doing homework). Smaller children may run, jump or climb constantly. The individual feels restless and has trouble with impulsivity. Someone who is impulsive may interrupt others a lot, grab things from people, or speak at inappropriate times. It is hard for the person to wait their turn or listen to directions. A person with impulsiveness may have more accidents and injuries than others.</li>
        <li>Combined Presentation: Symptoms of the above two types are equally present in the person.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="treatment" class="subheading">Treatment of ADHD</h2>
    <p>n most cases, ADHD is best treated with a combination of behavior therapy and medication. For preschool-aged children (4-5 years of age) with ADHD, behavior therapy, particularly training for parents, is recommended as the first line of treatment before medication is tried. What works best can depend on the child and family. Good treatment plans will include close monitoring, follow-ups, and making changes, if needed, along the way.</p>
    <h2 class="subheading" id="adult">ADHD in Adults</h2>
    <p>DHD can last into adulthood. Some adults have ADHD but have never been diagnosed. The symptoms can cause difficulty at work, at home, or with relationships. Symptoms may look different at older ages, for example, hyperactivity may appear as extreme restlessness. Symptoms can become more severe when the demands of adulthood increase.</p>
