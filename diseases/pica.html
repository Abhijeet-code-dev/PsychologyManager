    <h2 class="subheading">What is pica? </h2>
    <p>Pica is an eating disorder in which you eat items of no nutritional value that are not typically viewed as food. This might happen as a result of a nutrient deficiency — your body’s way of telling you that it needs more of a certain nutrient. Anyone can experience pica, but it’s more common during pregnancy and childhood.
        <br>The cultural perception of the items you eat matters. For example, eating clay is a cultural practice for some groups of people in the world. For people in these groups, the consumption of clay would not be seen as evidence of pica because it makes sense given certain customs and traditions. <br>
        However, if the consumption of “inedible” substances persists for over a month, and there’s no cultural reason behind these eating habits, then it’s likely you are experiencing pica.

        <h2 class="subheading">Pica in children</h2>
        <p>
            Pica is more common in children than adults. A 2018 study surveyed 1,430 schoolchildren in Switzerland, finding that more than 10%Trusted Source of children might experience pica at some point.
            <br>
It’s important to note that mouthing objects is commonplace in certain developmental stages of life, typically before the age of 2. Taking this into account, healthcare professionals don’t typically diagnose pica in children under this age.

        <h2 id="treatment" class="subheading">Treatment of Pica</h2>
        <p>
            Treatments for eating disorders can differ.
<br>

<br>
If your doctor thinks your pica is caused by nutrient imbalances, they may prescribe vitamin or mineral supplements.
