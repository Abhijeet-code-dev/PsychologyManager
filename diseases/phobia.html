    <h2 class="subheading" id="phobia">What is Specific Phobia?</h2>
    <p>A specific phobia is an intense fear about an object or situation. Phobias involve symptoms of both anxiety and avoidance.<br>
        Phobias aren’t just extreme fears — they’re irrational fears. This means that the anxious feelings are larger than the true danger that the object or situation poses.<br>
        For example, if you fear heights, you might feel extreme anxiety or panic if you go above the 10th floor of an office building. This would be an irrational fear, as the building would have multiple security measures in place to keep you safe.
    </p>
    <h2 id="symptoms" class="subheading">Symptoms of specific phobias</h2>
    <p>The symptoms of specific phobias usually first appear in adolescence or adulthood, with an average onset of 7 years old. Children’s fears often disappear by themselves, but in some, they persist into adulthood.
        <br>
        According to the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-5), the symptoms associated with specific phobias — fear, anxiety, and avoidance — persist for 6 months or moreTrusted Source. Without treatment, they can persist for years or decades.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subheading">Physical symptoms</h2>
    <p>n people with a phobia, seeing or thinking about a feared object or situation activates the body’s defense system, known as the fight-or-flight response.
        <br>
        This is a natural response in humans and animals. It aims to prepare the body for danger. This response gets triggered when the body thinks it detects a threat.<br>
        Common physical symptoms related to specific phobias include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>heart palpitations</li>

            <li>chest pain or discomfort</li>
            <li>feeling nauseated</li>
            <li>dizziness</li>
            <li>feeling lightheaded</li>
            <li>fainting</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Children may express their anxiety differently than adults with behaviors that include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>crying</li>
            <li>tantrums</li>
            <li>freezing, or becoming very still despite feeling very anxious on the inside</li>
            <li>clinging to a caregiver</li>
            
        </ul>
        <h2 class="subheading">Psychological Symptoms</h2>
        <p>Psychological symptoms of specific phobias include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a feeling of imminent danger or doom</li>
            <li>feeling the need to escape</li>
            <li>a fear of losing control</li>
            <li>intense discomfort</li>
